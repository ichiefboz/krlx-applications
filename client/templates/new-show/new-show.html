				<div class="hide-mobile">
					<p>Standard shows are weekly radio shows for individuals and small groups. Most students play music or read the news, but some get creative by playing cards, over-analyzing physics in YouTube videos live on air, or hosting a political talk show.</p>
					<p>If you've got something you want to share, a Standard show will give you and your friends a weekly opportunity to do so.</p>

				<div class="hide-mobile">
					<p>Are you a fan of a particular artist, genre, or theme within music? A Bandemonium show is a great chance to explore some musical facet for two hours on a Sunday evening. Play the music, discuss the history, and showcase the best parts of your chosen subject that most people wouldn't know about.</p>
					<p>Bandemonium is 5-7pm on Sundays. Your show will fill this slot during one week.</p>
